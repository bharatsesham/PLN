# PLN
Perpetual Learning Network (PLN) is developed as a combination of neural networks, in which a conditional generative adversarial network is used to fabricate images similar to adversarial attacked (FGSM or C&W) images. Then these images are used to train a strong classifier for further improvment in accuracy.
